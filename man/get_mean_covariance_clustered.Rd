\title{Get prespecified mean and covariances for the Gaussian distribution from which the data come.}
\usage{
get_mean_covariance_clustered(choice, mean_dist)
}
\arguments{
\item{choice}{Taking 1, 2, 3, or 4, this function offers four choices to allow different settings of data distribution.}

\item{mean_dist}{This argument specifies the distance between the mean of two Gaussian distribution.}
}
\value{
This function returns a list including `mean_zero`, `mean_one`, `mean_two`, `cov_zero`, `cov_one`, `cov_two`. Zero corresponds to the major distribution, one and two correspond to two distributions in the mixture of Gaussian.
}
