# Readme

The package has been installed on a server with intel i9 core for convenience. 

**Steps to test the package and run the demo:**

1.   Access the RStudio Server via the following link [http://104.238.221.181:8787/](http://104.238.221.181:8787/)

     Enter username: lingui and password: 6520test

2.   Open the demo files `demo.Rmd` and `demo_clustered.Rmd` in the `/home` folder.

3.   Run the code. You can change the `choice` and `mean_dist` to allow different settings of distributions.

     > Since the server has a small memory, please run `rm(list = ls())` to clear cache at the beginning of each setting.
     > If the server breaks down unfortunately, please refresh the page and start it again. Sometimes entering into *safe mode* is useful.
     > Please contact lg625@cornell.edu for any issues and concerns. Thank you for your cooperation!


Please refer to the pdf file in the repo as the manual of the package.


If you want to install the package on the server, please download the `balancedrandomforest.tar.gz` in the repo and install it in your own machine. 

Thanks!
